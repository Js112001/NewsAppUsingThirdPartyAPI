# News App Using Third Party API
This is a news app using only html, css and javascript. It uses third party api calls to fetch data and displays using javascript.
You just have to pull or download the files and **put your APIKEY** in those javascript files where its needed.
# From where to get API key?
I have got this API from [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/hub). You just have to sign up and go to **newscatcher news api** and subscribe it. **Remember without subscribing the API you will get a 403 - Forbidden server error**
